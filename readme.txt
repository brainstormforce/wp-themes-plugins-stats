== Description ==

The WP Advanced Stats plugin automatically fetch theme and plugin stats ( name, active installs, 5-star ratings, etc. ) from the WordPress.org repository and store it. These stats can be shown anywhere on the website using shortcodes. 

Displaying real numbers build trust for visitors! 

Let's say you compared two WordPress themes along with some statistical parameters like - Active Installs, 5 Star Ratings, Total Downloads, etc. As these values keep changing everyday it was a manual work to copy& paste values from the WordPress.org repository. But not anymore! 

The WP Advanced Stats plugin provides an easy and simple way to display stats with shortcodes. You just need to add shortcode once and the plugin will automatically update the values from as per WordPress.org repository. 
Display Stats Using Shortcodes

**Different shortcodes are available to display the following values - for both - Theme and Plugins from WordPress.org repository.**

+ Theme/Plugin Name 
+ Total Active Installs
+ Last Updated       
+ Theme/Plugin Version       
+ Theme/Plugin Ratings       
+ 5 Star Ratings    
+ Average Ratings
+ Total Downloads
+ Download   
+ Total Active Installation of All Themes/Plugins [For authors]
+ Total Download Count of All Themes/Plugins [For authors]

**The plugin provides global settings under the “General ” tab. You can format the stat value/ number.**

1. Set an interval to check and update stats values 
As mentioned earlier stats keep changing every day. You can choose a number of days for updations. The plugin will fetch the latest stats after this interval and update values on the website automatically.  

2. Choose the stat value format to make it easily readable
 Usually, installation & download count is a big number. So it is quite hard to count and read the actual value. Simplifying this large number with notations make it more readable like - a number 1,000,000 can be displayed as 1M/1 Million or 1000K/ 1000 Thousand. 
Moreover, you can select a format to group numbers, like -  1,000,000 (comma) or 1.000.000 (dot)

3. Set a date format as per convenience 
WordPress default date formats are available for customizations. 

Connect to theme/plugins on WordPress.org repository

**Choosing a theme/plugin to fetch stats from is very simple.** 

1. Visit theme/plugin on WordPress.org repository
2. Copy the slug
3. Add it in a shortcode 

The plugin will fetch stats vis slug.
